The journey for Pycon India started at on 2nd November, 2017. It was a four day event the first two days were dev sprints and the main conference was on the 3rd and the 4th day. I left for Delhi from Mumbai on 2nd November by an early morning Flight. This was the first time i was travelling with Vistara, and yes they pamper their customers alot. The fights are on time, awesome crew and delicious food too ðŸ˜›. 

I reached the venue and it was already lunch time. I had lunch and then went to dev sprints area. Here i attended some lightning talks on docker, code linting using coala, docker swarm, kubernetes etc. I send a patch for RDO Documentation which got merged. Most of the time in these to days i was volunteering for preparation for the conference. On the 2nd day late evening was fun we packaged the goodies the Google Pendrives and the T shirts. Later that night me and my other friends went out for dinner, It was as Mexican themed restaurant. The actual plan was to goto barbaque Nation but when we reached there it was full. Then what we (saptak) used zomato for some fancy restaurant which was in the same building, Zomato did show that it was pricy later the bill did proved it. Like this was not enough we went to PVR at DLF Mall watch a 11:00 pm show of Thor: Ragnarok. I the movie had lot of puns and i was tired and sleepy even the 360Rs spent could not keep awake. My mind was like the seats are comfy and the jokes in the movie were not that great (dont may be because i was sleepy). I slept after watching like 30 mins of the movie, I do remember having some popcorns in between.

The 1st Day of the conference I was busy in organising stuff looking after the smooth distributing goodies as, i was head goodies distribution. During the same day I also got opportunity to meet few speakers before their talk. You always learn something new from of them. Later in the evening we had DGPLUG meet followed by dinner. The 2nd Day I was done with the my work so I visited the booths at the conference interacted with people and attended some talks. I had to leave bit early as my flight back to mumbai was at 8:50 the conference venue was far from the airport and I could not take chance on Delhi Traffic. All in all the the whole experience fabulous. 
Looking forward for next Pycon India 2018.
